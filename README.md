# ForcePaste
This is a python script that pastes text.
When you first read the description it doesn't make sense. I will explain it:
Whenever you make a new account in a website, they ask for your information.
If you try to paste (Ctrl + v) it won't work. The script I wrote, makes it possible to write in those boxes.

For windows users, after you have saved your .pyw file. Make a shortcut of it, and go to the shortcut's properties. 
From there you make the program run with a shortcut such as: Ctrl + Shift + v

The file is a .pyw and not a .py extension.
Because a .pyw extension works without a console, which makes it closer to the bulit in paste (Ctrl + v).
